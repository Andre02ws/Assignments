# Creating Sentences Assignment
For this assignment, you’ll create a program that turns array elements into a sentence. You should create a function that takes an array of words, as an argument. Your function should loop through the array and add each element into an empty string. The function should return a sentence as its final output. To make this program, you’ll use your programming skills to create an array, declare a function, and use a for loop.
# Debugging Assignment
For this assignment, you'll work on debugging programs. There are 4 checkpoints or programs in this assignment. You are required to run and debug each program using the techniques learned during the lesson. As you click on each checkpoint, you'll be presented with a scenario that you have to debug.
# Fortune Teller Assignment
For this assignment, you’ll create a fortune teller game. The program should allow the user to pick a number between 0 to 10. Then, the program should read the number and output a fortune. If the number is between 0 and 3, then they have a low fortune. If the number is between 4 and 7, then they have an average fortune. If the number is between 8 and 10, then they have a great fortune. Otherwise, any other fortune should not be read by the program. To set up the game, you’ll use your programming skills to declare variables, use comparison operators, and create conditional statements.
# Working with Basics
For this assignment, you’ll create a short story in VS Code. You’ll create variables to represent different elements of the story. The program should include the following basic data type variables: 1 array, 1 boolean, 3 integers, and 4 strings. To add more details to your story, you can create more variables as you develop the program. Once you have completed your program, you can copy and paste your code to JavaScript Tutor to see how the variables are being stored in memory.
# Pac-Man Project
For your first project, you'll be working on part 1 of the PacMan exercise. Your task is to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction when it reaches the edge of the page. Through this exercise, you'll learn how to control the DOM. The DOM holds data such as HTML objects or elements of a webpage. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with the concept of DOM. You'll learn about working with the DOM later in the course.
# Pac-Man Factory
In the first part of the assignment, you were able to create a PacMan and make it move across the screen. In this activity, we're going to take that a step further. 
Your task in this activity is to create a PacMan on demand (button click) and move these PacMen across the page:
By the end, you should have results similar to the video page referenced below. You can navigate to the video to review the project description. This video is located in Section 5: Pre-Class Videos.
Video Name: Introduction To The PacMen Exercise And Factory For PacMen
If you have any questions or blockers, ask your instructor for help.
Here's how the game is played:
When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new PacMan should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the PacMan or PacMen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given Pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
The starter code includes comments to guide you through this activity.
